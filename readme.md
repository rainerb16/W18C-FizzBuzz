# Classic FizzBuzz but in Python

Have a function that takes in one number as an argument<br/><br/><br/>
This function will:<br/><br/>
print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3<br/><br/>
print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5<br/><br/>
print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5<br/><br/>
The function should only ever print once per number!<br/><br/>
Hard code a list of random numbers with at least 15 numbers inside<br/><br/>
Run the function created for each number in your list.<br/><br/>
